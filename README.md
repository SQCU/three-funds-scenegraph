this is the pickiest gott darn thing I've run in my entire life
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
1 WRITE SCRIPTS INTO /THREEJS/.  
2 RUN SERVER.PY TO RUN LOCAL TEST SERVER W/ CORRECT MIME TYPES  
3 TRY NOT TO CRY  
4 CRY A LOT  
5 http://localhost:8080/  

# CONSIDERATIONS FOR DEV
so yeah this thing is a real stinker, it succks, it chucks,,  
make absolutely sure you do not modify the foldering structure of  
threejs/build  
threejs/examples  
they contain scripts that call each other based on expected relative position of other files.  
this is haunted, it is a haunted library.
